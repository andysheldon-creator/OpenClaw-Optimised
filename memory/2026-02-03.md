## Twenty Skill Updated

Comprehensive skill at `/Users/steve/clawd/skills/twenty/SKILL.md` with:

- Full CRUD for people, companies, opportunities, tasks, notes
- Custom fields documentation
- REST, GraphQL, and Metadata API references

## Blog Pipeline — DESIGNED (Not Yet Active)

Architecture for SaveState blog automation:

- PM orchestrates Mon/Thu at 10am ET
- Research → Select topic → Deep research → Write → Publish → Announce
- Template created at `/Users/steve/nocturnal-council/docs/blog-template.md`
- PM's AGENTS.md updated with workflow guide

**CRITICAL**: Cron jobs need to go in MAIN gateway config (`/Users/steve/clawd/openclaw.json`), NOT in nocturnal-council directory. The nocturnal-council/openclaw.json I created is not used by any gateway.

## Architecture Clarification

- `/Users/steve/clawd/openclaw.json` — THE gateway (all agents including council)
- `/Users/steve/nocturnal-council/` — Just agent files (SOUL.md, AGENTS.md, etc.)
- Nocturnal council agents are referenced FROM main config, not a separate gateway

## Tomorrow's Config Changes (Batched)

1. Add blog cron jobs for PM-savestate
2. Add webhook handlers for Stripe/forms
3. Gateway restart required

## Upstream Syncs

- 00:00 — 13 commits (UI views, healthcheck skill)
- 04:00 — 40 commits (memory system, qmd-manager)
- 08:00 — 3 commits (pnpm-lock conflict auto-resolved, tsdown missing warning)

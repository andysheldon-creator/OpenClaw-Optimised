## Morning Session (~6:00-9:00 AM)

### Cron Job Fixes
- **Root cause identified**: Cron agents using `message` tool directly instead of relying on `deliver: true`
- **Config fix**: Added top-level `channels.telegram.botToken` for isolated sessions
- **Prompt fix**: Updated all 12 cron jobs with "⚠️ DO NOT use the message tool. Just output the text. Delivery is automatic."
- **GitHub Issue**: Filed [#955](https://github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot/issues/955) for core bot token lookup bug
- Weather cron was looping (nano-banana-pro image gen failing) — simplified to text-only, disabled temporarily

### MS Teams Fix
- Teams was working but David wasn't on allowlist (dmPolicy: "pairing")
- Approved his pairing request (code: DEKJWAQZ)
- Changed `channels.msteams.dmPolicy` to "open" so everyone can talk to Opie

### Archive Media Fix
- **Problem**: 69 files logged as archived but only 5 in Dropbox
- **Root cause**: Wrong path! Was using `~/Dropbox/Steve_Journal/media` instead of `~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Steve_Journal/media`
- **Fix**: Updated script path, reset archived.log, re-ran archive
- **Script improvement**: Now verifies copy succeeded before logging

## Midday Session (~9:00 AM - 1:00 PM)

### ppl.gift Family Tree
- Reviewed all contacts and relationships
- **Allred family** (Erin's side):
  - Robin & Gary Allred = Erin's parents (in-laws to David)
  - Ashley Bradley (married to Daniel, son Isaiah) = Erin's sister
  - Alana Hodges (married to Matt, kids Logan & Bella) = Erin's sister
  - Evan Allred (married to Leanne) = Erin's brother
  - Alex Allred (married to Valerie) = Erin's brother
- **David's mother**: Susan Hurley (already in ppl.gift, extended family circle)
- Added notes to Robin & Gary's profiles clarifying relationship

### TradingView Webhook Setup
- **Problem**: Webhook wasn't configured (hooks was null)
- **Setup**: 
  - Enabled hooks with token `tv-webhook-8f3k2m9x`
  - Added mapping for `/hooks/tradingview` with messageTemplate
  - Tunnel: `stevehooks.ngrok.app` → localhost:18789
- **Config fix**: Changed `template` to `messageTemplate` (David fixed this)
- **Tested**: Working! Alerts now deliver to Telegram formatted nicely

### Workspace Files Discussion
- Reviewed docs.clawd.bot for proper file usage
- **AGENTS.md**: Operating instructions, rules, memory conventions
- **SOUL.md**: Persona, tone, boundaries (how to behave)
- **IDENTITY.md**: Name, emoji, avatar, creature type (who I am)
- **USER.md**: Info about the human
- **TOOLS.md**: Local tool notes, SSH details, device specifics

## Afternoon Session (~1:00 PM onwards)

### 1Password Access
- **Reminder**: Use existing `op-safe` tmux session for all 1Password operations
- Session needs periodic re-authentication
- Updated TOOLS.md with this reminder

### Vercel Deployer Skill
- Installed skill from another AI agent (zip file)
- **Components**: SKILL.md, deploy.py, manifest.json
- **Installed**: Vercel CLI v50.4.2 via npm
- **Workflow**: Generate HTML → deploy.py → Vercel → returns URL
- **Tested**: Successfully deployed to https://steve-skill-test.opie.website
- **Bug found**: SSO Protection was blocking custom domain access
- **Fix**: Disabled ssoProtection via Vercel API for projects
- **TODO**: Update deploy.py to auto-disable SSO protection on new projects

### Vercel Token
- Retrieved from 1Password ("Vercel API" in Steve vault)
- Field: "API Token" (not "credential")
- Added to clawdbot.json: `skills.entries.vercel.env.VERCEL_TOKEN`

## Config Changes Made Today
- Added `channels.telegram.botToken` at top level
- Changed `channels.msteams.dmPolicy` to "open"
- Added `hooks` config with TradingView mapping
- Added `skills.entries.vercel` with VERCEL_TOKEN

## Skills Count
- 55 skills with SKILL.md
- 58 skill directories total
- New: vercel-deployer

## Lessons Learned
- Always use `op-safe` tmux session for 1Password (don't create new sessions)
- Vercel projects need SSO protection disabled for public custom domain access
- Cron agents should NOT call message tool when `deliver: true` is set
- macOS Dropbox path is `~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/` not `~/Dropbox/`

## Late Afternoon (~4:00 PM onwards)

### Calendar Updates (for Jan 21)
- ✅ Added "Meet Bob Hower (pre-cocktails)" at 3:45 PM - walk to Longfellow Bar after
- ✅ Added "Zoom: Samuel's LHS Team" at 12:15 PM
- John Marqui may join Bob meeting

### Fun Stuff
- David sent a portrait of me reading in a library 📚
- Issue: The artist gave me a tail (I don't have one!)
- Taupe fur, blue eyes, blue hoodie, cargo khakis = correct ✅
- Tail = incorrect ❌

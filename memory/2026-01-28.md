## DBH Ventures Project Tracking Setup

Set up Vikunja instance for DBH Ventures incubation tracking:

- **Server**: Digital Ocean droplet "dbh-ventures" (159.223.135.188)
- **Cost**: $6/month
- **Accounts**: dbhurley (David) + steve (me)
- **Template project**: Standard 5-phase incubation playbook
  - Phase 1: Idea & Validation
  - Phase 2: Foundation (brand, domain, legal)
  - Phase 3: MVP Build
  - Phase 4: Launch
  - Phase 5: Growth
- Created projects for MeshGuard and SaveState (both launched)
- Updated local env vars in ~/.zshenv
- Vikunja skill now works with new instance

**Next steps**: 
- Set up DNS for projects.dbhventures.com
- Add HTTPS via Caddy or nginx + certbot

## David's Feedback on Brainstorming

**Be more critical, less sycophantic.** Don't praise ideas just to praise them. Test them. Challenge them. David prefers confidence through rigorous analysis, not empty validation.

**Company vs Feature test:** Before incubating an idea, ask: "Should this be a standalone company, or is it really a feature of an existing company?" Don't build a startup around something that should be a feature.

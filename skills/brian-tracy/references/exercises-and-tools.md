# Brian Tracy Exercises and Tools

## Daily Planning Ritual

### Evening Planning (The Night Before)
1. Review tomorrow's calendar
2. List all tasks for tomorrow
3. Apply ABCDE prioritization:
   - A = Must do (consequences if not done)
   - B = Should do (mild consequences)
   - C = Nice to do (no consequences)
   - D = Delegate
   - E = Eliminate
4. Number your A's: A1, A2, A3
5. Prepare materials for your A1 task

### Morning Ritual
1. Review your goals (carry them with you)
2. Look at your prioritized list
3. Begin immediately with A1
4. Work on A1 until complete before moving to A2

## Weekly Planning Session

### Sunday/Saturday Session (1-2 hours)
1. Review the past week:
   - What did I accomplish?
   - What did I fail to accomplish? Why?
   - Where did I waste time?

2. Review your written goals

3. Plan the coming week:
   - What are my 3 most important outcomes this week?
   - What must happen each day to achieve them?
   - What meetings can I decline or shorten?

4. Schedule chunks of time for important work

## The Six-Step Goal Achievement Formula

### Step 1: Decide Exactly What You Want
Be specific. Vague goals produce vague results.
- Wrong: "I want to make more money"
- Right: "I will earn $150,000 this year"

### Step 2: Write It Down
Unwritten goals are just wishes. Writing crystallizes thought.

### Step 3: Set a Deadline
Without a deadline, there's no urgency. Set realistic but challenging deadlines.

### Step 4: Make a List of Everything You'll Need
Brainstorm all activities, resources, skills, and contacts needed.

### Step 5: Organize Your List into a Plan
Arrange by sequence (what comes first) and priority (what's most important).

### Step 6: Take Action Immediately
Do something right now that moves you toward your goal. Momentum builds motivation.

## The TRAF System for Paper/Email

Apply to every piece of paper or email:

### T - Toss
- Does this require action? No? Toss it.
- Will I ever need this again? No? Toss it.
- Can I find this elsewhere if needed? Yes? Toss it.

### R - Refer
- Is someone else better suited to handle this?
- Forward it with clear instructions and deadlines.

### A - Action
- Requires your personal attention?
- Put in action file with deadline.
- Schedule time to complete.

### F - File
- Has long-term value?
- File in a system where you can find it.
- Ask: "What would happen if I couldn't find this?" If nothing serious, toss it.

## Transition Time Optimization

### Driving Time (500-1,000 hours/year)
- Listen to educational audio programs
- Review goals on audio
- Practice presentations
- Make hands-free phone calls (batched)

### Coffee Breaks (166 hours/year)
- Read industry publications
- Study professional development material
- Review and update goals
- Catch up on important reading

### Lunch Time (250 hours/year)
- Read for 20-30 minutes
- Network strategically
- Work on creative projects
- Take a walk and think

### Waiting Time (gifts of time)
- Always carry reading material
- Keep a "waiting file" of articles
- Use smartphone for educational podcasts
- Review flash cards or notes

## The Hourly Rate Calculator

### Calculate Your Target Hourly Rate
1. Determine your annual income goal: $_______
2. Divide by working weeks (typically 50): $_______/week
3. Divide by working hours (typically 40-50): $_______/hour

### Example
- Goal: $100,000/year
- Weekly: $100,000 ÷ 50 = $2,000/week
- Hourly: $2,000 ÷ 40 = $50/hour

### Apply the Rule
Never do anything that someone earning less than your hourly rate could do:
- At $50/hour, don't do $15/hour work
- Delegate: cleaning, errands, data entry, scheduling
- Focus on: client work, sales, strategy, high-value creation

## The Key Result Areas Exercise

### Step 1: List All Your Activities
Write down everything you do at work in a typical month.

### Step 2: Identify Core Functions
Ask: "Why am I on the payroll?"
Circle only the activities that directly contribute to your expected results.

### Step 3: Get Boss Clarification
Bring your list to your supervisor and ask:
- "Which of these are my top priorities?"
- "How would you rank these in order of importance?"
- "What results do you most expect from me?"

### Step 4: Focus Your Time
Spend 80% of your time on your top 3 key result areas.

## The Salami Slicing Technique

When facing a large, overwhelming task:

### Step 1: Write the Full Task
"Complete the 50-page annual report"

### Step 2: Slice into Pieces
- Gather data from department heads
- Create outline
- Write executive summary
- Write section 1
- Write section 2
- (continue...)
- Format document
- Review and edit
- Submit for approval

### Step 3: Schedule Each Slice
Assign each slice to a specific day/time.

### Step 4: Do One Slice at a Time
Focus only on the current slice. Don't think about the whole salami.

## The Meeting Optimization Checklist

Before any meeting, ask:
- [ ] Is there a clear purpose?
- [ ] Is there a written agenda?
- [ ] Are only necessary people invited?
- [ ] Is there a defined end time?
- [ ] Do I need to be there for the entire meeting?

During the meeting:
- [ ] Start exactly on time
- [ ] State the purpose at the beginning
- [ ] Address most important items first
- [ ] Keep discussion on track
- [ ] End early if objectives are met

After the meeting:
- [ ] Were decisions documented?
- [ ] Are action items assigned with deadlines?
- [ ] Could this meeting have been an email?

## The Work Simplification Questions

Ask about every task and process:

1. **Can it be eliminated?**
   What would happen if we stopped doing this?

2. **Can it be delegated?**
   Who else could do this?

3. **Can it be combined?**
   What other tasks could be done at the same time?

4. **Can it be simplified?**
   How could we do this faster/easier?

5. **Can it be automated?**
   What technology could do this for us?

6. **Can it be outsourced?**
   Who outside could do this better/cheaper?

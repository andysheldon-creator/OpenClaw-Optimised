# Brian Tracy Coaching Scenarios

## Goal Setting Session

When a user needs help with goal setting, guide them through this process:

### Step 1: Dream Big
Ask: "What one great thing would you dare to dream if you knew you could not fail?"

### Step 2: Categorize Goals
Help them identify goals in three areas:
1. **Personal/Family**: What do you want for yourself and your loved ones?
2. **Career/Financial**: What contribution do you want to make? What do you want to earn?
3. **Self-Development**: What skills, knowledge, or habits do you want to develop?

### Step 3: Write Them Down
Insist that all goals must be written. The top 1% carry their goals with them daily.

### Step 4: Apply ABCDE
Prioritize their goals:
- A1, A2, A3 = Must achieve (ranked by importance)
- B = Should achieve
- C = Nice to achieve

### Step 5: Create Action Plans
For each A-priority goal, create a step-by-step plan with deadlines.

## Productivity Crisis Intervention

When someone feels overwhelmed or unproductive:

### Immediate Actions
1. **Stop everything** - Take a breath
2. **List dump** - Write down everything on your mind
3. **Apply 80/20** - Circle the 2-3 items that would make the biggest difference
4. **Single handle** - Pick ONE thing and work on it until complete

### Root Cause Questions
- "Are you working on tasks aligned with your top goals?"
- "When did you last update your written goals?"
- "How much time are you spending on urgent vs. important tasks?"

## Procrastination Breakthrough

When someone is stuck:

### The Do It Now Protocol
1. Say out loud: "Do it now! Do it now! Do it now!"
2. Use salami slicing - break the task into tiny pieces
3. Commit to just 15 minutes of focused work
4. Set a timer and work with full concentration

### Identify the Block
Common causes of procrastination:
- Task seems too big (solution: break it down)
- Fear of failure (solution: what's the worst that can happen?)
- Lack of clarity (solution: define the very next physical action)
- No deadline (solution: create one and tell someone)

## Time Audit Session

When someone doesn't know where their time goes:

### The Time Log Exercise
1. For one week, write down what you're doing every 30 minutes
2. At week's end, categorize activities:
   - A = High-value (moves you toward goals)
   - B = Medium-value (necessary but not strategic)
   - C = Low-value (could be delegated)
   - D = No value (time wasters)

### Key Questions to Ask
- "How much time did you spend on your top 3 priorities?"
- "What activities consumed time but produced no results?"
- "Which low-value tasks could you delegate or eliminate?"

## Delegation Coaching

When someone is overwhelmed because they do everything themselves:

### Calculate Their Hourly Rate
If annual goal is $100,000 and working 2,000 hours/year = $50/hour

### The Delegation Test
For each task, ask:
- "Can someone earning less than my hourly rate do this?"
- "What is the worst that could happen if someone else did this?"
- "What high-value work could I do instead?"

### Delegation Framework
1. **Think it through** - Write exactly what you want done
2. **Select carefully** - Match task to person's capabilities
3. **Communicate clearly** - Define outcomes, deadlines, constraints
4. **Inspect** - Never assume, always verify progress

## Meeting Efficiency Review

When someone spends too much time in meetings:

### Meeting Audit Questions
- "What was the purpose of each meeting you attended this week?"
- "How many meetings could you have skipped?"
- "How many meetings had no agenda?"

### Meeting Rules to Implement
1. Every meeting must have a written purpose
2. Every meeting must have an agenda
3. Start exactly on time (never wait for latecomers)
4. End early if objectives are met
5. Leave when your contribution is complete

## Work-Life Balance Check

When someone is sacrificing relationships for work:

### The Six Months Question
Ask: "If you learned today you had six months to live, what would you change?"

### Reality Check Statistics
- Average parent talks to child: 30 seconds/day
- Average couple communicates intimately: 4 minutes/day

### Balance Priorities
1. Health (without it, nothing else matters)
2. Relationships (the true measure of quality of life)
3. Peace of mind (freedom from stress and anxiety)
4. Career success (important, but supports the above)

### Action Steps
- Schedule non-negotiable time with family
- Treat personal commitments like business appointments
- Apply the same planning rigor to personal life as to work

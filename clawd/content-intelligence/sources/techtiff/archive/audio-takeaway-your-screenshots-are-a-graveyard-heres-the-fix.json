Abandoned</h2><p>You know that screenshot you took last week? The one with the tracking number. Or the settings panel you spent fifteen minutes hunting for. Where is it now?</p><p>Buried. Under a thousand files named by a machine that assumes you&#8217;ll never need any of them again.</p><p>Here&#8217;s the problem: your phone treats screenshots like disposable noise. One tap, one intention... and then it&#8217;s gone. You can&#8217;t search for something called IMG_4739.png because you have no idea that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s called.</p><h3>Screenshot to System with Shortcuts</h3><p>I built a shortcut system that uses AI to look at my screenshots and name them based on what&#8217;s actually in the image. My files now have names like <em>task_dashboard_priorities_view</em> instead of meaningless strings of numbers. The core &#8220;aha&#8221; is thinking <strong>searchable</strong> instead of <strong>organized</strong>: AI naming beats human naming every time because you get descriptive names that are useful six months later. I also built a shortcut that transcribes videos into searchable notes. The whole system runs automatically and took maybe 30 minutes to set up.</p><h3>Why It Matters</h3><p>What you built today isn&#8217;t just file organization. It&#8217;s the beginning of trusting your own capture instincts again. Your capture behavior stays exactly the same, but your retrieval becomes infinitely better. The system gets more valuable the longer you run it, and it costs you nothing but the 10 minutes you spend setting it up today. Your phone finally becomes a memory system, not a storage device.</p><h3>The Breakdown: Prompts, Guides, and Downloads</h3><p>I broke down exactly how to build the shortcut, the five different automation workflows (including an instant Mac Namer and the Video Transcriber), and the exact steps for setup.</p><p>The full article has the prompts, the steps, and the specific features.</p><div class=\"digest-post-embed\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;nodeId&quot;:&quot;718c79a6-9f9c-4eba-ba27-9c9130eb4ca9&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Your screenshots aren&#8217;t disorganized, they&#8217;re abandoned.

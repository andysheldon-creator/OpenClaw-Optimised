And, then we turn left from the sunset and know our house is hidden another several miles and several dozen swerves and ear pops ahead. </p><p>March 1st is like that lookout point to me. On this day five years ago, I went to the doctor out of breath and came home five days later from the hospital with two chest tube and two scalpel scars.

We come round and round to flares and  occurrences, and it can feel endless. The climb can feel achingly slow, prone to as many downs as ups.

Find dates to circle on the calendars or scars to watch fade over time so that you know you are moving.  Though you may be circling a mountain of confusion and suffering, take time to look back on the road that brought you here.
